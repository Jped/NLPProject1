# NLPProject1
1st Project for NLP Course 
In this project we were taksed with creating a document categorizer.
[The project instructions can be found here](http://faculty.cooper.edu/sable2/courses/spring2018/ece467/NLP_Spring2018_Project1.docx)

I implemented a categorizer using Rocchio Classification and categorized 85% of the document correctly in Professor's test set.
